    This release is another smaller release that focuses on bumping the
    supported dependencies and updates the test matrix in advance of future,
    larger changes. As always, recent versions of Python (3.12, 3.13) and
    Django (5.0, 5.1) are now supported, while support for older Python
    (3.7, 3.8) and Django (3.2, 4.0, 4.1) versions has been removed. More
    information is included below.
